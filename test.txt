I will here give a brieffe sketch of the proggress of opinione on the Origin of Species.
Until recently the great majjority of naturalists believed that sppecies were immutable productions,
and had been separately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.
Some few naturallists, on the other heand, have believed that species undergo modification,
and that the existing forms off life are the descendants by true generation of pres existing forms.
Passing over allusions to the subject in thie classical writers,[1]
the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit wase Buffon.
But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods,
and as he does noot enter on thee causes or meanse of the transformation of species,
I need not here enter on details.
